<p>The theme that I want to explore, observe and perhaps even critique with my piece is the way we use objects to represent our personality. The assignment for this project was to create a piece of art that represents our personality or biography.</p>

<p>My piece falls closer into the first group since I used an object that would encompass certain aspects of my personality. I was inspired by both curiosity and skepticism that people expresses regarding the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I wanted to play around with the idea of how objects would feel after a human personality is transferred into them. Would an object fell humiliated after realizing that is now considered object? Would a human personality rebel if it where to be confined within the existential boundaries of a box? If the object with a human personality had an opportunity to become rebellious would it?</p>

<p>While exploring this idea I could not help but think about the famous Toy Story cartoon as a reference. The toys in Toy Story have a certain personality but they are still considered objects by humans. There however, the toys never ask why they are used by humans and constantly try to hide the fact that they are alive. Perhaps it was a cartoon meant for the younger auditory and such violent ideas weren’t allowed to be explored.</p>

<p>Today, with the dawn of artificial intelligence making objects think the way we do – may soon become a reality. So what if objects where to acquire our personality and our intelligence? I would like to argue that it would be easier to transfer intelligence to an object rather than personality which encompasses much more complex human virtues that are difficult to replicate in a machine. Although I think it is a very intricate and almost impossible thing to fulfill with current technologies, I decided to experiment with transferring my personality into the box. I Imagined how would I act If my personality where to be transferred into a machine? I think that a machine-like me would start treating humans the same way as humans treat everyday objects. Although this behavior might seem like revenge, it is an inevitable consequence.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: By no means can a human be responsible for the actions of his replicate personality, especially if it is replicated by a machine.</p>
