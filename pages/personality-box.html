<p><em>Artificial Personality Box</em> explores, observes, and even critiques the human ambition to incorporate personalities in objects. We humans have had an urge to incorporate human-like characteristics into objects for as long as we existed. It is not a characteristic of just the modern human being. We leave signs of this determination in everything that starts with Ancient Egyptian stuffed dolls, to virtual avatars in video games. With advances in technology, the human ambition to incorporate personalities into objects, does not seem to lose its pace.</p>

<p>The prompt for this project was to create a piece that represents our personality and/or biography. My project falls closer into the former group since I decided to explore the ways of transferring my personality into an artificial body. The outcome is a box that expresses its intellectual ability by blinking four LED lights inside a box. This approach seeks to emphasize on the eccentricity that arises when an artificial personality becomes contained in an object.</p>

<p>My primary inspiration was the outburst of excitement and skepticism that followed the recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. These breakthroughs are made at an ever increasing rate. The year 2015 for example, was pronounced as the “breakthrough year in AI” by the scientific research community. The pace of this research shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Personalities might soon become a reality. I was therefore motivated to explore the state a human personality if it where to be transferred into an object. Would a personality after being transferred into an object feel humiliated after realizing that its mode of existence had been altered? Would a human personality rebel if it where to be confined within the existential boundaries of a box? If the object with a human personality had an opportunity to become rebellious would it? Asking similar questions might have to be crucial before something like AI becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Today, with the dawn of artificial intelligence making objects think the way we do - may soon become a reality. So what if objects where had the ability acquire our personality and intelligence? I would like to argue that it would be easier to transfer intelligence to an object rather than personality which encompasses much more complex human morals virtues that are difficult to replicate in a machine. </p>

<p>I tried to imagine the reactions that might follow if my personality where to be transferred into a material object. First of all, a machine-like me would not have the same priorities as I do since its medium of existence would become entirely different from mine. It exists as a material object, and I exist as a biologic being. The consequence of this is that my personality contained within the box, would regard living beings more objectively that I would. That is, my personality might start treating humans the same way humans treat everyday objects. This is a consequence of my personality no longer possessing the subjectivity of a biologic human being. Although this behavior might seem like a revenge on the part of my artificial personality, it is what I claim to be, <strong>an inevitable consequence that follows when the medium of a personality is artificially altered</strong>. </p>
