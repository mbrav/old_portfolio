<p>According to the project’s philosophy, the world and everything that constitutes it relies on a constant process of rebirth and decay. Each moment is an experience of an individual mind-state such as a thought, a memory, a feeling or a perception. A mind-state arises, exists, and since it is impermanent, it soon ceases, following which the next mind-state arises. Thus the consciousness of a sentient being can be seen as a continuous series of birth and decay of these mind-states. Regardless, rebirth always remains the most persistent among these processes.</p>
