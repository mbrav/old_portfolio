<p>According to the philosophy that this project manifests, everything that constitutes the world, relies on a constant process of rebirth and decay. Each moment of an expereince of an individual mind-state of a thought, a memory, a feeling, or a perception. A mind-state arises, maintains its existance, and since it is impermanent, it will eventually follow a process of decay. But even after its decay, there will be the next mind-state and the process will repeat. The consciousness of a sentient being is a continuous series of births and decays of these mind-states. The beauty behind this philosophy, is that despite the abundant number of decaying processes in the natural world, rebirth remains the most persistent aspect of existence.</p>

<p>In the animation I represented this process in the context of seasons. As the Pagoda flows through the seasons, it is aware that a day will come when it will no longer stand. Its existence will someday become annihilated, but only for a finite time. The seasons that accompany the pagoda, are reminders of the rebirth/decay cycle. After pagodaâ€™s fall, the process of rebirth will immediately follow. It might come soon, or an eternity will pass before it does. But the seasons have thought the pagoda patience and persistence. By embracing these virtues, the pagoda flourishes and continues through the process. </p>

<p>The inspiration for this project was drawn from the movie called <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> (2000) directed by a Chinese director Ang Lee who is also well known for being the director of <em>Life of Pi</em> (2012).</p>
