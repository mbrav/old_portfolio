<p>According to the philosophy that this project manifests, is how the world and everything that constitutes it relies on a constant process of rebirth and decay. Each moment is an experience of an individual mind-state such as a thought, a memory, a feeling, or a perception. A mind-state arises, exists, and since it is impermanent, it eventually decays after until the next mind-state arises. The consciousness of a sentient being is a continuous series of births and decays of these mind-states. The beauty behind this philosophy, is that birth is always the most persistent of these processes.</p>

<p>In the animation I represented this process in the context of seasons. As the Pagoda flows through the seasons, it is aware that a day will come when it will no longer stand. Its existence will someday become annihilated, but only for a finite time. The seasons that accompany the pagoda, are reminders of the rebirth/decay cycle. After pagodaâ€™s fall, the process of rebirth will follow. It might come soon, or an eternity will pass before it does. The seasons have thought the pagoda patience and persistence. By embracing these virtues, the pagoda flourishes and continues through the process. </p>

<p>The inspiration for this project was drawn from the movie called <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> (2000) directed by a Chinese director Ang Lee who is also well known for being the director of <em>Life of Pi</em> (2012).</p>
