<p>With <em>Artificial Intellect Box</em> the theme that I want to explore, observe, and even critique, is the way human ambitiously seek to incorporate personalities in objects. This human characteristic is not a new, . The prompt for this assignment was to create a piece that represents our personality and/or biography. My piece falls closer into the first group as I explored the ways of transferring my personality into an artificial body. </p>

<p>I was inspired by both the outburst of curiosity and skepticism that follow the ongoing breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI). I wanted to play around with the idea of the state of an object if a human personality is transferred into it. Would a personality transferred into an object feel humiliated after realizing that its mode of existence has been altered? Would a human personality rebel if it where to be confined within the existential boundaries of a box? If the object with a human personality had an opportunity to become rebellious would it?</p>

<p>While exploring this idea I could not help but think about the famous Toy Story cartoon as a reference. The toys in Toy Story have a certain personality but they are nevertheless considered as objects by humans. In this movie however, the toys never ask why they are human objects. By dropping dead on the floor whenever a human walks into the room, they constantly try to hide the fact that they are alive. The idea that is not explored in the movie, is rebellion that might arise when objects like toys, posses the level of cognition and personalities as that of humans. Perhaps Toy Story was a cartoon meant for the younger auditory and is the reason why such provocative ideas were not explored.</p>

<p>Today, with the dawn of artificial intelligence making objects think the way we do - may soon become a reality. So what if objects where to acquire our personality and our intelligence? I would like to argue that it would be easier to transfer intelligence to an object rather than personality which encompasses much more complex human morals virtues that are difficult to replicate in a machine. Although I think it is a very intricate and almost impossible thing to fulfill with current technologies, I decided to experiment with transferring my personality into the box. I imagined how would I react if my personality where to be transferred into a machine? First of all, a machine-like me would not have the same priorities as I do since its medium of existence is entirely different from mine. The consequence of this might be that I would regard living beings objectively and be more prone to embracing materialist-like machine values. I might start treating humans the same way humans treat everyday objects. Although this behavior might seem like a revenge on the part of my digitalized personality, it is an inevitable consequence that follows when the medium of an intelligence is artificially altered.</p>
