<p>With <em>Artificial Intellect Box</em> the theme that is explored, observed, and even critiqued, is the human ambition to incorporate personalities in objects. This however is not a characteristic of just the modern human being. Humans have had an urge to incorporate human-like characteristics into objects, almost everywhere that is in the range between Ancient Egyptian stuffed dolls and online virtual pets. With advances in technology, this human ambition does not seem to lose its pace.</p>

<p>The prompt for this project was to create a piece that represents our personality and/or biography. My project falls closer into the former group since I decided to explore the ways of transferring my personality into an artificial body. </p>

<p>I was inspired by both the outburst of excitement and skepticism that followed the recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. I was therefore motivated to explore the state of an object if a human personality where to be transferred into it. Would a personality transferred into an object feel humiliated after realizing that its mode of existence has been altered? Would a human personality rebel if it where to be confined within the existential boundaries of a box? If the object with a human personality had an opportunity to become rebellious would it?</p>

<p>While exploring this idea I could not help but think about Pixar&#8217;s <em>Toy Story</em> cartoon as a reference. The toys in <em>Toy Story</em> have a certain personality but they are nevertheless considered as objects by humans. In the movie however, the toys never ask why they are humans&#8217; objects. By dropping dead on the floor whenever a human walks into the room, they constantly try to hide the fact that they are alive. The idea that is not present <em>Toy Story</em>, is that rebellion might arise when objects like toys start possessing the same level of cognition and personality as human beings. Perhaps Toy Story was a cartoon meant for the younger auditory and is the reason why such provocative ideas were not explored.</p>

<p>Today, with the dawn of artificial intelligence making objects think the way we do - may soon become a reality. So what if objects where to acquire our personality and our intelligence? I would like to argue that it would be easier to transfer intelligence to an object rather than personality which encompasses much more complex human morals virtues that are difficult to replicate in a machine. </p>

<p>Although I think it is a very intricate and almost impossible thing to fulfill with current technologies, I decided to experiment with transferring my personality into the box. I tried to imagine the reactions that might follow if my personality where to be transferred into a material object. First of all, a machine-like me would not have the same priorities as I do since its medium of existence is entirely different from mine, It exists in a material object, and I exist as a biologic being. The consequence of this is that my personality contained within the box, would regard living beings objectively and be more prone to embracing materialist-like machine values. I might start treating humans the same way humans treat everyday objects since my personality would no longer posses the subjectivity of being a human being. Although this behavior might seem like a revenge on the part of my artificial personality, it is what I claim to be, an inevitable consequence that follows when the medium of an intelligence is artificially altered. </p>
