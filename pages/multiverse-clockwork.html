<p>For this creative coding project I wanted imitate the animations that were popular when <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> (1971) movie was filmed. During that time, computer graphics first started to emerge. I wanted to create an animation that would encompass the aspects of CG if it were to be applied in the A Clockwork Orange movie, but with the inclusion of a few animations that would convey multiverse theory concepts. The translation of a orange circle came out more literal than the translation of the multiverse concept, but this turned out to be in parallel with their comprehensibility. The multiverse theory concepts are influenced by Jim Holtâ€™s book called <em>Why Does the World Exist?</em>.</p>

<p>The animation starts with the original ClockWork theme melody which signifies the low complexity of one universe. This part of the animation is meant to be literal. As the music progresses into a more progressive form, the animations become more intricate, abstract, and complex. This is an attempt to convey the complexity of multiverse theories which are abstract to our comprehension as are the animations that try to represent them.</p>

<p>The way this coding project was taking its path easily emerged into such a theme and has yielded pretty satisfying results. The code itself is almost 700 lines long. Since it was written in a disorganized fashion, this gives it a sense of irony; it can only be understood by it creator. This is an aspect of the multiverses theory where we might not be capable of grasping what it outside our universe since it is beyond out comprehension.</p>
