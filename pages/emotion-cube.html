<p><em>Emotion Cube</em> is a small wooden enclosure that senses physical movements, touches, changes in light, and changes in temperature. Depending on the level of these changes and interactions, the cube expresses various light patterns, colors, and vibrations. If left alone for some time, the cube will express a fading light pattern that signifies its loneliness. When one interacts with it, the cube comes to life by responding with a blinking and vibrating pattern.</p>

<p>The intent behind the creation of this object was to replicate the feeling of loneliness or excitement depending on the number of interactions an object gets. In a way, it imitates the desire that humans have towards socially interacting with other humans. As a consequence, it suffers when it feels emotionally deprived from these interactions. As an object, the cube would most likely remain not interacted with for a long time. The video therefore demonstrates the cubeâ€™s expression of loneliness caused from being deprived from its social necessities.</p>
