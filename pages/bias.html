<p>At an age of digitally augmented media, digital bias is transforming into something inherent in the nature — a species conditioning itself to take control over almost any natural system by means of technology. Humanity's destiny is quite certain, technology is becoming less of a tool, and more of a prosthesis that is actively shaping the human. But what does using technology mean when we us its as a construction material of our natures? Does it make us more truthful and rational, or does it do the opposite? </p>

<p>Along the biases that are already inherent in biologic human nature, technology seems to extend the list of these biases and prejudices even further. Human biases have become the inherent products of digital capitalism and consumer societies — products that are becoming increasingly inconspicuous to human awareness, as they hardwire the human consciousness. Human bias is a catalyst for the instrumentality of mass sensation, desire, marketing, and political sentiment. It is the equivalent of a nervous system that is being actively stimulated with electrodes, distracting the mind from thinking rationally.</p>

<p>Too little information is viewed as a deprivation from freedom of speech, but too much information, to an extent that it becomes imperceptible — is not viewed as deprivation from freedom of speech. But distraction is the key instrumentality of <em>bias</em> — it breeds control, subversion, and manipulation. Excessive abundance of information transforms rationality into an oblique signal, fainted by news about Taylor Swift’s sex life, the new iPhone, and a politician’s hair style. But the information that surfaces, is based on intent of either the global Silicone Valley, or insurgent algorithms. Freedom is not just a set of actions that an ideology permits an individual to make, but it must be first and foremost, be a state of an unbiased mind. Without rationale, freedom becomes an instrumental term of oppression. </p>

<p>As humanity invents new emergent forms of media consumption, we also embrace the biases that are adherent to these mediums. Mass media feeds, corporate endorsement, rhetoric, and undigested radical ideologies — are served to the human consciousness through the arteries of digital technology. While humans condition themselves to trust and embrace these technologies, we are also conditioning an increasingly biased human nature.</p>
