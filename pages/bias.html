<p>At an age of digitally augmented media, <em>digtial bias</em> is transforming into something that is becoming inherited in the nature of <em>homo cyberneticus</em> -- a species conditioning itself to take control over almost any natural system by means of technology. Humanity's destiny is quite certain, technology is becoming less of a tool, and more of a prosthesis that is actively shaping the human condition.</p>

<p>Human nature is imperfect, Technology is frequently viewed as a solution to the immense number of human cognitive biases. Technology brings a promise of establishing a more rational human nature, but in practice, it has also shown that it can be used as a rhetorical tool for manipulative persuasion, even in &quot;free&quot; societies. Human cognition has the potential to form an even more immensely biased human nature. </p>

<p>But sometimes, technology can escape before humans even learn how to tame it, or are able to realize its long-term consequences. Such an invention had almost turned out to be the atom bomb, which was miraculously tamed, before causing an even further proliferation and a final chapter of life as we <em>narrowly</em> know it. Such a chapter is chaotic from our perspective, but poetic to an extraterrestrial visitor, who would embark on our planet and remark: &quot;a species that let technology escape&quot;, take a few deep breaths, and continue onto his next journey around other planets -- similar to the way we continue on with our their daily lives after a visit to an archeological museum filled with fossilized dinosaurs.</p>

<p>How do we manifest bias?</p>
