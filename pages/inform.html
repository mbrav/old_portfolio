<h3>Physical Computing Tool</h3>

<h3>March 2015</h3>

<p>This project is an attempt to explore certain fields in
technology that remain uninfluenced in non-technical
applications. One of these technologies that would defend
the argument is Object Relational Mapping (ORM) which is
a field in the sphere of technology that lacks an initiative
for innovation. It’s effectivity has proven to not be
significant due to the non-substantial ways of its
application. The project will explore wether the reason for
ORM’ ineffective applications are the principles based on
which its data relations are drawn. The relation between
data will be created with the help of a physical computing
device that will gather data from the physical environment
and visualize it using a technology based medium.</p>
