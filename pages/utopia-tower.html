<p>The critique point that <em>Infrastructural Utopia Tower</em> seeks to emphasize on, is the way our modern society has become significantly reliant on infrastructures and automated systems. For a modern human, infrastructure has become second nature. Without infrastructure, humankind would think it has been placed in the wilderness.</p>

<p>One of the concerns that infrastructure provokes, is based on how humans attempt to apply it almost everywhere while advances in technology aid this ability. Infrastructure is meant to be built in technological environments. We are affected by it, most of the time without without even noticing; hundreds of wires pass through walls, dozens of pipes are laid beneath us, and an unknown number of radio frequencies pass through our bodies. All this illustrates infrastructure’s overwhelming presence, yet, it is cleverly engineered to remain unnoticed. </p>

<p>“Infrastructure everything” - is a slogan that is subconsciously ingrained in almost every modern human being. “Infrastructural Utopia Tower” is an infrastructure, the way it was built reflects this aspect. The way it was realized however, is unlike its intended utopian model. It was meant to stand like its model, manifesting the ideals that have the potential to be realized. This realization did not happen, and the existence of the ideal did not go beyond a 3D model on an LCD screen. What has been realized however, is an anti-utopian application of infrastructure within the tower. The structure transformed into a breeding ground for humankind to infrastructialize as much estate that nature can provide. The outcome is an anti-utopian looking tower that reflects this human characteristic.</p>

<p>This piece also touches on government surveillance. Surveillance however, is not made possible without it&#8217;s underlying framework - infrastructure. When an infrastructure is built, one should not wonder why someone can easily take advantage of it. It is a system designed to remain hidden to its intended user, and neverthless remain manipulable. Infrastructure is meant to be controlled and manipulated, this aspect frequently is overlooked since the root <em>infra</em> in the word infrastructure - means closed. Combating surveilance is pointless if one is not aware of the underlying framework that surveilance is builded on. </p>

<p>The tower was meant to proclaim digital freedom, a tool aimed at maintaining a free democratic society. But digital technologies like internet, arguably, are one of the most manipulable infrastructures that humankind has every built. Today like never before, someone can control the outcome of something that is located on the other side of the globe, or know everything about the individuals the surround him. We are all part of a grid of infrastructures that provide us with resources, commodities, and sustainable living conditions. Even in the most remote places on Earth, infrastructures consist of satellites that fly above one’s head. Digital technologies are crucial in allowing these infrastructures to function in unison. </p>

<p>The question that has to be asked is whether infrastructures can be used as means for maintaining freedom. Is there a point where freedom can become instrastructialized given the increase in our reliance on technologies? What is the balance between what should be inrastructuralized, and what should not? If our living conditions can be easily provided through infrastructured means, can freedom eventually be “served” like tap water? If infrastructure is so unnoticeable, what is the truth that it hides?</p>
