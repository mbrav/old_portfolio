<p><em>Infrastructural Utopia Tower</em> is an art installation that emphasizes on the way our modern society has become reliant on infrastructures and automated systems. For a modern human, infrastructure is second nature. Without infrastructure, a human would think he/she had been placed in the wilderness. Us humans, attempt to apply infrastructures almost everywhere while the technological advances only aid this process.</p>

<p>Infrastructure is meant to be built in technological environments. We are affected by it, most of the time without even noticing; hundreds of wires pass through walls, dozens of pipes are laid beneath us, and an unknown number of radio frequencies pass through our bodies. All this illustrates infrastructure’s overwhelming presence, yet, it is cleverly engineered to remain unnoticed. We have the privilege to blindly use the word “working” to describe the thousands of operations that infrastructures perform on a daily basis. This however, is a burden as much as it is considered to be a privilege. </p>

<p><em>Infrastructural Utopia Tower</em> also emphasizes on government surveillance. Surveillance however, is not made possible without it&#8217;s underlying framework - infrastructure. When something becomes infrastructuralized, one should not wonder why it can be exploited for someone else&#8217;s advantage. It is a system designed to remain hidden to its intended user, and nevertheless remain manipulable. Combating surveilance becomes ineffective if one does not realize the implications of its underlying framework on top of which it is built. Infrastructure by definition is meant to be controlled and manipulated, this aspect is frequently overlooked since the root in the word infrastructure, <em>infra</em> - means closed. The technologies we use on a daily basis is perfect example of how hidden technologies can abstract their intended function.</p>

<p>“Infrastructuralize everything” - is a slogan that is subconsciously ingrained in almost every modern human being. It is a process that has to welcome reflection on our part since the perplexities that arise from it, might not always be apparent. <em>Infrastructural Utopia Tower</em> is an infrastructure, the way it was built reflects this aspect. The way it was realized however, is unlike its intended utopian model. It was meant to stand like its 3D model, manifesting the ideals that have had the potential to be realized. This realization did not happen, and the existence of the ideal did not go beyond a 3D model on an LCD screen. What has been realized however, is an anti-utopian application of infrastructure within the tower. The structure transformed into a breeding ground for humankind to infrastructialize as much estate that nature can provide. The outcome is an anti-utopian looking tower that reflects this human characteristic.</p>

<p>The piece features a Wi-Fi spot that sniffs the user data as he/she browses the internet. This serves as a metaphor that illustrates infrastructure&#8217;s constant connectedness. The tower’s intention is not to hide the infrastructure away from the user, but show its overwhelming presence, authority, and control. An aspect that infrastructures do not have the possibility to show since they remain constantly hidden.</p>

<p>The tower was meant to proclaim digital freedom, an important tool for maintaining a free democratic society in our present. But digital technologies like the internet, are arguably, one of the most manipulable infrastructures that humankind has every built. Today like never before, someone can control the outcome of something that is located on the other side of the globe, or know everything about the individuals that surround him. We are all part of a grid of infrastructures that provide us with resources, commodities, and sustainable living conditions. Many infrastructures also rely on other infrastructures which translates into us being part of the infrastructural grid as well. Even in the most remote places on Earth, infrastructures consist of satellites that fly above our heads. It sounds more literal than it might appear, but when it comes to infrastructures, humans are never in “offline” mode.</p>

<p>The question that has to be asked is whether infrastructures can be used as means for maintaining freedom. Is there a point where freedom can become instrastructialized given the increase in our reliance on technologies? What is the balance between what should be inrastructuralized, and what should not? If our living conditions can be easily provided by infrastructured means, can freedom eventually be “served” like tap water? Once infrastructures become tools for providing human dependencies in very abstracted ways, would human beings not be blind enough to notice this malicious process? If infrastructures are meant to remain so unnoticeable, what is the truth that they hide? These are questions that must be made by a technologically advancing civilization, especially by its citizens.</p>
