<p>This bot explores the boundaries of authorship of artwork generated by autonomous systems. When an autonomous system develops to a point where it has a decent form of computational creativity, a re-examination of its copyrights might also be necessary. If this where to happen, the aesthetics and even morals that determine what is art and what is not art, would most likely have to be redefined. On the other hand, we as humans have drastically altered the mediums and technologies through which art is expressed and conveyed. Beginning with Neanderthal cave paintings, and ending with the vast number of digital and virtual art mediums of today. But when humans come to a point where they use “tools” not as leverages, but as entities with an ability to autonomously generate art, could art still be defined as an outlet of human expression, or should it be categorized as a material form of amusement? </p>

<p>What is the limit of what we define an agent that produces artwork “decent” enough to have a copyright attribution? If art extends beyond the boundaries of an expressive performing artifact, <em>art</em> might define just about any object/visual that has been subjected to manipulation.</p>

<p>The technologies behind this bot, allow <em>him</em> to autonomously generate procedural artwork for an indefinite amount of time, with near infinite combinations. The bot produces visuals with a form of marvel that might justify it to have certain artistic qualities. For one thing, a trigonometric formula is the underlying mechanism behind the visual generation and is not a completely uncharted form of art. Ossacip Bot however, might not seem to posses the justifiable quality of uniqueness that can formally approve its artistic potential. It’s inner functioning is exposed to the internet that allows it to have an indefinite amount of instances. Someone may choose to create millions instance of this bot and flood the internet with fractal animations.</p>

<p>The question that welcomes an answer, is what is the boundary between the <em>art</em> and the <em>material artifice</em> when it comes to artwork generated/produced by an autonomous system.Is expression a necessary prerequisite for defining a legitimate art piece? Where is the boundary between a tool used as a mean for creating artwork, and a “tool” that can crate artwork autonomously? Given the fact that objects with no intellect do not have the potential to produce an intelligible artist statement based on expression, can an autonomous system even have the right for artistic authorship?</p>
